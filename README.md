# Dynamic birth and death of Argonaute gene family functional repertoire across <i>Caenorhabditis</i> nematodes

## Description of files
### N0.tsv
Orthogroup assignments from OrthoFinder for all 51 <i>Caenorhabditis</i> species analyzed.
### AGO Subfamily Assignments.xlsx
Gives the AGO subfamily that all 1213 Argonaute genes were assigned to, for both Argonautes detected by OrthoFinder and Argonautes that were missed by OrthoFinder (yet still have Argonaute functional domains).
### Argonaute_sequences_1213_final_set.fa
FASTA file of protein sequences for all 1213 Argonaute genes.
### 1213_Argonaute_protein_alignment_ClustalOmega.txt
Multiple sequence alignment of all 1213 Argonaute protein sequences in Argonaute_sequences_1213_final_set.fa.
### panamensis AGO Structures
Top level of the directory contains PDB files of predicted protein structures for the 7 divergent <i>C. panamensis</i> Argonautes (CSP28.g16020.t1, CSP28.g16021.t1, CSP28.g16024.t1, CSP28.g16025.t1, CSP28.g16026.t1, CSP28.g16027.t1, and CSP28.g8935.t1), as well as <i>C. panamensis</i> CSR-1 (CSP28.g5632.t1). Subdirectories contain the full output from each run of ColabFold used to predict these structures.
